##Introduction
Storage Keeper is a simple console application created with .Net technology which aims to help people with the organization of their storage space, such as wardrobes, attics or basements. It allows for storing things in a more efficient and sorted way. Users can use the app to save information about stuff in the storage so they can remember what they have hidden and where. Also, they can update the stock and categorize what is stored and how much.

The right attitude to work and enthusiasm for developing my skills make my strong points. Also, I am open-minded and ready for new challenges, and my passions are games and programming, which is why I graduated with first-class honours degree in games development in 2021. My dissertation project was about creating an augmented-reality card game. I developed it with Unity and Vuforia. During my last year of university studies, I found a job as a unity application developer at WSP, which was a massive success in my life as I managed to handle academic duties and work at the same time. Currently, I am responsible for delivering ConnectAll platforms, which are consultation rooms for industrial and public investments. The projects require various skills and tools. For example, I work with Unity to set up and render out the scene, or I use Blender and 3ds Max to create 3d models. The final product of my efforts is a website, which I also develop.
